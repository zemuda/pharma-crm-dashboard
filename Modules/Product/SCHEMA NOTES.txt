Classification of combination products (to the top)
- Pharmaceutical products containing two or more active ingredients are regarded as combinations (incl. combination packages) 
    and given different ATC codes from plain products containing one active ingredient.  
- Stereoisomeric mixtures are regarded as plain products.  Medicinal products which in addition to one active ingredient contain auxiliary substances intended 
    to increase the stability of the product (e.g. vaccines containing small amounts of antibacterials), increase the duration (e.g. depot formulations) 
    and/or increase the absorption (e.g. different solvents in various dermatologicals) are considered as plain products
